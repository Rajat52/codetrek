## How to participate and share your progress during sessions
1. Check in every morning during a session for a fresh exercise. You need to go to the issues tab and look for something like `Day 2 at Developing Interfaces`.
2. During the day, add a comment in the issue. Your comment should mention how many items you have completed and how many remains. Make this a task list using GitHub. [Read here on how to create a task list in GitHub.](https://help.github.com/articles/about-task-lists/)

3. Check your email every night during a session to get the code for that day's exercise. Compare this with your code and answer the following queries:
    1. Does your code look similar to the code provided?
    2. What are the things you missed? What are the things you put extra?
4. If you think you are way behind and cannot catch up before next exercise begins, you can use the code provided to start the next exercise. Make sure you come back and complete your code after the session.
